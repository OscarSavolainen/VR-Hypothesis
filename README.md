# VR-Hypothesis
Some code to calculate how likely we are to be in a Virtual Reality

This is the code from my blog post on the Virtual Reality Hypothesis: 
A detaied explanation of each of the functions can be found there.
I share in case others want to experiment with different input parameters and sub-functions, to try get a more accurate estimate of our/your likelihood of being in a VR.
There is probably a lot of improvement to be made to the predictive functions, and I think I will be messing with this project for a long time to come.

The code is MATLAB-based, but is quite simple if someone wants to port it to a different language.
